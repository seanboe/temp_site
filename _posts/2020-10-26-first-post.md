This is my first post on this new blog! I've never done any web development before, so this is going to be a cool chance to learn some new stuff! I'm hoping to use this blog to encourage myself to make and share cool stuff. I've always thought it would be fun to show-off my creations... I guess I'll do that here!

## How did I make this website? 
I used jekyll/github pages and the [ghost/jasper2](https://github.com/jekyller/jasper2) layout. I also followed [this tutorial](https://asw.in/blog/Easiest-Way-To-Create-A-Jekyll-Blog) which *happened* to use the same layout.

Whatever. The website looks good, and I'm happy. Hopefully I'll be able to populate this soon with things like Arduino projects, Arduino projects, and Arduino projects, and maybe some cool books I've read or things I've done for school. 

Bye!!
