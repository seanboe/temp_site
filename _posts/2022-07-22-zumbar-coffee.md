I like coffee now.

This is a bit of a different post, but something is telling me that I need to write it.

I've hated coffee since I was younger, but about 2 months ago, upon being introduced to the incredible coffee addiction of one of my friends, I gave it another try, and I loved it. That coffee was a simple cold brew from Starbucks that seems naive to my now distinguished coffee taste. It was too sweet, too watery, and not coffee enough. Since then, my mind has been awoken to how good coffee can really be. 

ModalAI is very close to a coffee shop called zumbar that my parents have always raved about. It's really small and quite pricey, but I decided to go there last week on a whim. Their coffee is incredible. It's indescribable. On the one hand, there is nothing remarkable about it; it's not sweet, not bitter, and not even that... coffee-like. But I realized that's exactly what makes it good coffee, and more coffee-like than the typical bitter, slightly poopy drink that comes from the average coffee machine. 

Instead of being bitter, there is a very delicate softness in the taste. Combined with a smooth, liquid (yet not like water) texture, I can only imagine that it is what a tree may feel as soft, morning wind brushes past it's leaves. Amazing.

I've only gotten mocha's there since they're so good, but I should probably diversify next time...

Did I mention that they also have very good blueberry muffins? _Really_ good blueberry muffins? They're very light and springy with a crispy, sweet top. It's really good, although I prefer eating the muffin after the coffee since it slightly distracts from the coffee experience. You just can't have two good things at once.

Also, in my opinion, getting the coffee in a paper to-go cup makes it taste better than when it's in a porcelain mug, although that looks nicer. Maybe there's no difference (probably), but there is an unmistakble feeling that I only get when drinking from the paper cup.
