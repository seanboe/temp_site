At school, whenever entering the library in periods other than lunch, before school, or after school, it is necessary to fill out a google form for attendence. As someone who visits the library every day during these hours, this is incredibly annoying. Using the power of python, I decided to fix this by writing a simple script to automagically fill out the form for me. It's actually incredibly satisfying to watch:

I used the sellenium library in python for this project. You can see the github repository [here](https://github.com/seanboe/autoFormer)
