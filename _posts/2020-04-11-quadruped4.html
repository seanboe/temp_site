<p>Huh? <i>Another</i> degree of freedom? The Y-axis!</p>

<p>Yep, another degree of freedom! This time, it's to move the foot in the y-axis, or away from the sides of the body. The math for this stage is trigonometry again, however it is a bit more complex that before. 
  This time, I'm going to use 2 diagrams to explain the math:
</p>

<p>First, take a look at Digram 1. There are two things that need to be solved for: length <b>B</b>, which is the demand shoulder-foot length, and <b style="color: aqua;">Œ∏</b>,
which is the angle that needs to be sent to the motor to achieve the Y-axis input (specified by length <b>A</b>). To solve for <b>B</b>, you can take advantage of the two triangles that 
are formed; use <b>A</b> and <b>D</b> to solve for <b>C</b> with the pythagorean theorem: C = ‚àö(<b>A</b><sup>2</sup> + <b>D</b><sup>2</sup>). <b>C</b> is the hypotenuse of another right triangle,
so the pythagorean theorem can be used again: <b>B</b> = ‚àö(<b>C</b><sup>2</sup> - <b>E</b><sup>2</sup>). Don't forget the <b>E</b> is constant (it is the actual length of the motor to the shoulder.</p>

<p>Now, here comes the tricky part. The method used to solve for <b>B</b> applies in all cases, but solving for <b style="color: aqua;">Œ∏</b> is somewhat case-dependent. Firstly, note that
I've defined the "ùüé" position of the foot (when <b>A</b> = ùüé) to be under the bearing. When the foot is at ùüé, it is actually tilted, and to get to be straight, <b>A</b> must equal <b>E</b>. For 
diagram 2 to apply, <b>A</b> is actually defined as a negative value.
Now, let's start: I'll initially be refering to diagram 1. First, solve for angle <b>a</b> (I refer to this as theta in my code). This can be accomplished by any trigonometric function (since all sides are known and <b>C</b> considers the 
other lengths appropriately) but I chose to use tangent: <i>tan</i>(a) = ( <sup>A</sup> / <sub>D</sub> ) , or a = <i>tan</i><sup>-1</sup>( <sup>A</sup> / <sub>D</sub> ). Now, skip over to solve 
for <b>b</b> (note that I call this alpha in my code). <b>b</b> can be solved easily with cosine: b = <i>cos</i><sup>-1</sup>( <sup>E</sup> / <sub>C</sub> ). This is the part that requires insight:
angles <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> add up to form an angle which (in the case of diagram 1) is greater than 90¬∞; the part not covered by the 90¬∞ angle formed by the yellow lines is <b style="color: aqua;">Œ∏</b>.
When <b>A</b> becomes less than <b>E</b>, however, (<b>a</b> + <b>b</b>) is less than 90¬∞; in this case, <b style="color: aqua;">Œ∏</b> = 90¬∞ - (<b>a</b> + <b>b</b>). Isn't that cool?</p>

<p>So what if <b>A</b> is less than ùüé? Refer to diagram 2: notice that <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> overlap (and don't worry, <b>b</b> will always be greater than <b>a</b>... yes, I checked) and 
  <b style="color: aqua;">Œ∏</b> now partly forms the 90¬∞ angle. In this case, <b style="color: aqua;">Œ∏</b> =  90¬∞ - (<b>b</b> - <b>a</b>). Both cases can be summed up like here:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
  <td>If <b>A</b> > 0:</td>
  <td><b style="color: aqua;">Œ∏</b> = abs(90¬∞ - (<b>b</b> + <b>a</b>))</td>
  <tr class="even">
  <td>If <b>A</b> &#60; 0</td>
  <td><b style="color: aqua;">Œ∏</b> = abs(90¬∞ - (<b>b</b> - <b>a</b>))</td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td>If <b>A</b> &#60; <b>E</b>:</td>
  <td><b style="color: aqua;">Œ∏</b> = -1 ‚úñÔ∏è <b style="color: aqua;">Œ∏</b></td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Here's the end result!</p>

<p>But there is one more thing to consider: what happenns to <b>B</b>? Well, <b>B</b> is simply passed on to the other stages of the program as the z-axis input. It gets inputted into the stage that 
considers the x-axis, which outputs its own z-axis to the final stage that calculates the z-axis motor angles. This can be done because <b>B</b> is the x-axis output on a new, tilted plane ( 
  if <b>A</b> is ever specified, the whole leg tilts inward right?); the <i>Y</i> plane. All other stages lie on this plane.</p>

<p>Confusing? That's because it is. This entire stage took me nearly a month of
designing, only to find out that my algorithms were wrong. This design I crunched out on a Tuesday night after finishing my Calculus homework. Soon, I'll have another post will all my failed ideas;
why they didn't work, or why I abandoned them (I had a really cool idea involving tangent lines and derivatives).</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the code. Note that I refer to <b>a</b> as theta and <b>b</b> as alpha, and I've created a function <code>solveFootPosition</code> to organize all the stages/calculations.
The big stuff from this post is held in <code>solveYMove</code>.</p>

<h6>Problems... so far:</h6>
<p>So far, no problems! I've tested this many times, with different x, y, and z positions and the math has been correct every time (I can check with a ruler to see if my x, y, and z inputs are 
  considered accordingly). I'm really proud of this setup, and hopefully it won't fail me in the future!
