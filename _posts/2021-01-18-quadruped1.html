<p>Since last summer, I've been wanting to start on a fairly ambitious project: building a 
quadruped robot that can walk and do cool static movements.
</p>
<br>
<p>I didn't have much time to start back then as school was about to begin, but over winter break, 
  I finally had time to truly start this thing. First, I decided to model everthing out in Fusion 360, 
  a CAD tool that would allow me to 3d print the parts out later. I also began finding and buying parts
  for testing, including motors, bearings, buck converters, and some teensies with shields. 
  By the end of the break, I had all of the mechanics figured out, and had been able to connect a teensy LC to a USB host 2.0 shield 
  using <a href="https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0" target="_blank"> this library </a>. Now two weeks later,
  I've begun programming movement on one leg, specifically vertical translation of the foot. The foot stays directly underneath the shoulder
  joint with input from a ps3 controller!

<p>Best of all, the math is really simple; It's all high school trigonometry!</p>
<p>Here's the "diagram" I'm going to refer too:</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/quadruped_pics/diagrams/legDiagramStandard.png" width=500 /></p>
<p>The main idea is to use the law of cosines, which allows you to relate three angles of a triangle to one side: C<sup>2</sup> = A<sup>2</sup>+B<sup>2</sup> - 2ABcos(c). In this case,
the goal is the move the foot vertically by inputing a demand length from the foot to the shoulder (in the diagram, length <b>C</b>). Since lengths <b>A</b> and length <b>B</b> are constant
(the literal length of the parts), it is possible to calculate the angle <b>c</b> as long as a feasible demand <b>C</b> is provided. You simply need to rearrange the formula like this:
c = cos<sup>-1</sup>( <sup>C<sup>2</sup> - B<sup>2</sup> - B<sup>2</sup></sup>&frasl;<sub>-2AB</sub> ). After that, the math is easy; cunningly, <b>A = B</b>, so the triangle is 
isoscles. This makes <b>a = b</b> too, so you can solve for <b>b</b> by using the fact that angular sums of a triangle are 180&#730;. <b>a</b> = <sup>(180&#730; - <b>c</b>)</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>. 
After that, tell the motors to go to <b>b</b> and <b>c</b>, and you're done!</p>
<br>
<p>Here's most of the code that deals with this math:</p>

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
void Kinematics::solveFtShldrLength(uint16_t controllerInput) {
  
  // Angles need to be mapped to motor zeros because servos don't turn 360 degrees
  if ((_legID == LEG_2) || (_legID == LEG_3)) {

    // Map controller input (0-255, 1 byte) to demand shoulder-foot length in cm
    uint16_t demandShoulderToFoot = map(controllerInput, 0, 1023, SHOULDER_FOOT_MIN, SHOULDER_FOOT_MAX);

    // Use the Law of Cosines to solve for the angles of motor 3 and convert to degrees
    double demandAngle3 = acos( ( pow(demandShoulderToFoot, 2) - pow(LIMB_2, 2) - pow(LIMB_3, 2) ) / (-2 * LIMB_2 * LIMB_3) );
    demandAngle3 = lrint( (demandAngle3 * 180) / PI);

    // Use demandAngle3 to calculate for demandAngle2 (angle for M2)
    double demandAngle2 = lrint( (180 - demandAngle3) / 2 );

    // Calculate final demand angles suited to motors
    demandAngle2 += M2_OFFSET;
    demandAngle3 = (M3_DEFAULT_ANGLE - demandAngle3) + M3_DEFAULT_ANGLE + M3_OFFSET;

    // Constrain motor angles and round the output to reduce noise
    demandAngle2 = _applyConstraints(2, demandAngle2);
    demandAngle3 = _applyConstraints(3, demandAngle3);

    // Set live motor angles to the newly calculated ones

    // motor 2:
    motor2.angleDegrees = demandAngle2;
    motor2.angleMicros = _degreesToMicros(motor2.angleDegrees, motor2.calibOffset);

    // motor 3:
    motor3.angleDegrees = demandAngle3;
    motor3.angleMicros = _degreesToMicros(motor3.angleDegrees, motor3.calibOffset);
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

<hr/>

<p>One of the things I'm most impressed with is the strength of this leg. The datasheet for these motors specified them to be 20kg-centimeters, and when I originally chose them,
it was because they were easily accessible and I estimated each motor to be strong enough to lift length <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> (12.5 centimeters). This gives each motor a
predicted strenght of 1.6kg at the end of the lever, however I assumed that a significant portion of this power would be lost due to the weight of other motors on a certain motor's
lever arm. For example, the motor moving the entire leg in the left-right direction (refer to the diagram above) needs to carry another motor, which moves the leg in the up-down
direction. When I was planning, I tried to reduce this effect by placing the motors as close together as possible. And it payed off: my leg can push on the ground with a strength of
nearly <b>1.5kg</b>!</p>

<h6>Problems...&nbsp;&nbsp;so far:</h6>

<p><b>1:&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts keep breaking.</b> More specifically, <i>one</i> part keeps breaking; the one that holds the x-axis motor (the motor that moves the entire leg horizontally,
from the perspective of the diagram image earlier). If they don't break, they don't grip the motor axle; the motor turns, but nothing else happens.</p>
<p><b>Update:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>this problem is fixed! Only took me six iterations...&nbsp;&nbsp;(the sixth one is in the robot currently). Newer versions progress right. </p>

<p><b>2:&nbsp;&nbsp;The PS3/PS4 controller connection is bad.</b> I've been connecting to the main microcontroller (teensy 4.1) from the controllers using this 
<a href="https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0" target="_blank"> USB host 2.0 library </a> and a mini USB 2.0 host shield. Right now, the library hasn't been updated to 
work with the teensy 4.1, so I've been running the usb host stuff on a teensy LC and communicating the data to the main teensy over I<sup>2</sup>C. At first I liked this, since 
the controllers are fun to use and the bluetooth connection was relatively stable. However, over time I found this to be clunky; intial setup was slow, a gazillion jumper cables
plagued my desk, and long-term connectivity issues became worse. I've now decided to get rid of this all together, and possibly build my own controller with two LoRA radios. That
will probably require a custom pcb, which may take me a while to finish (my AP chemistry final is two weeks away, and then the hardest unit in the class!).</p>
