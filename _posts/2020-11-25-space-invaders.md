I stumbled across this sitting in my documents folder a couple days ago and I minus well post it. About 2 years ago I made a space invaders game using an Arduino Uno (although I later upgraded to a teensy) and used it to learn to program in c++. I basically went from knowing nothing about c++ to using functions, pointers, structs, and libraries and learned as I went along... as a result, the code is put together really badly (inconsistent coding style, mainly), but maybe you can use it for reference if you're making your own space invaders. My setup included a tft display, three buttons (two for movement and one trigger), and a buzzer. It was really fun!
