A learning opportunity... for everyone!

Many Arduino club members are brand-new to all types of hardware and software. During the coronavirus lockdown period,
the arduino club executive team and I discussed ways we could keep club activities up and running. While the [arduino presentations](https://seanboe.github.io/blog/arduino-presentation)
were an immense success (our members really enjoyed them), it was still difficult to keep those without arduinos at home inspired. We needed 
a solution that could be accessible to everyone with a computer. 

Additionally, we had been wanting to run a type of programming summer camp for middle school and high school students at a local library.
With attendance numbers expected to be high for such events (an estimated 20 people... a lot for us!) it would be impossible to gain funding 
to purchase enough arduino kits to supply such an effort. 

We settled on a compromise between hardware and software; why not just run programming courses and do the hardware stuff after we've shown what 
we can do? It'll probably be easier to get funding for arduinos _after_ we've shown that our club has motivated members. 

And thus... I present to you: [Python Tutorials](https://wvarduinoclub.github.io/tutorials/python-tutorials/Setup/) brought to you by the members of 
Westview Arduino Club!

Soon, we hope to also have tutorials teaching basic c++, maybe java, and certainly arduino software/hardware. 

If you use our resources, please star our [github repository](https://github.com/WVarduinoclub/tutorials). This support is very encouraging!

Additionally, if you see issues, don't hesitate to publish a pull request fixing the problems. 

Enjoy!
