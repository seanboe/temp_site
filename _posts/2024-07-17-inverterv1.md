# This post is unfinished! 
I worked on this project a few months ago (and am writing the post retroactively) but haven't finished compiling what I did. There are lots of pictures / videos that I still need to put here. What exists now is a _very_ quick summary of what I did.


This summer I made a custom BLDC inverter and got it to run FOC ([field oriented control](/Users/seanboerhout/Documents/webDev/new-blog-portfolio/affiliates-jekyll-theme/_posts/2024-07-17-inverterv1.md)), which is one of the most efficient three-phase motor modulation schemes at lower speeds. I learned a lot, and it was really fun!

I first whipped the board together in KiCAD a few days after the last day of school. Fixing my bike and replacing some parts took much less time than I expected.

The board is built around the DRV8323 motor driver, which is basically three gate drivers and op-amps (for amplifying the phase shunts for current measurements). The MCU is an STM32G4, and I'm using an AS5047D absolute magnetic encoder - this guy is really popular throughout the hobbyist community for being pretty cheap and having pretty high resolution. Other peripherals include a CanFD transceiver and the [tiniest RGB led you've ever seen](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/w√ºrth-elektronik/150044M155260/9857930?s=N4IgTCBcDaIIwFYAMSAsqCyiFgGxJAF0BfIA). Pretty simple.

Here's the schematic:

[Skipping a lot here... I don't have time to write everything I want about this post yet!]

Here's a video of it working with FOC:
