The last time I posted anything here was over a year ago. Since then, a ton of things have happened - classes taught me how much I don't know, motorsports has taught me more (and made me considerably more jaded), and biomech has kept me... stressed. I've missed this blog. I miss working on things for myself and being able to put it all down on a page. Anyway... I'm going to blog more. 

Here's the actual about me: 

Hi, I'm Sean, a second-year student at MIT studying electrical engineering and computer science. This blog is meant to outline cool projects I've worked on, and hopefully it will be as inspiring to you as [Ben Katz's blog](https://build-its-inprogress.blogspot.com) at some point. Ben's blog is awesome, and you should read it. 

I'm also on [MIT motorsports](https://www.fsae.mit.edu), a club that builds an electric race car each year. This year we're doing four wheel drive (each wheel has an independent motor), and we're going to destroy. Hopefully. That's the plan... :D

Don't hesistate to reach out! Shoot me an [email](mailto:boeseany21@gmail.com) if you have questions or wanna chat. It can be about anything (robots, school, coffee, whatever).

You should also check out some of my friends' blogs too - they also have some cool posts!

If you're curious about how I made this, I used Jekyll and Github pages to build / deploy the site and used the [Affiliates Theme](https://bootstrapstarter.com/template-affiliates-bootstrap-jekyll/) with a few modifications (including dark mode!) to make this as cool as I could.
