Hi, I'm Sean, a first-year student at MIT! I really like making stuff (in particular, projects involving electronics), and this blog is meant to be evidence / the product of that. Hopefully, it will be as inspiring to you as [Ben Katz's blog](https://build-its-inprogress.blogspot.com) was to me. 

I'm also the steering lead on [MIT Motorsports](https://fsae.mit.edu), a team of super cool people of which I'm priviliged to be apart of.

If you're curious about how I made this, I used Jekyll and Github pages to build / deploy the site and used the [Affiliates Theme](https://bootstrapstarter.com/template-affiliates-bootstrap-jekyll/) with a ton of modifications (including dark mode!) to make this as cool as I could.
