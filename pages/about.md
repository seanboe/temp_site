Hi, I'm Sean, a first-year student at MIT! I really like making stuff (especially projects involving electronics), and this blog is meant to be the product of that making. Hopefully, it will be as inspiring to you as [Ben Katz's blog](https://build-its-inprogress.blogspot.com) was to me. 

Some of my coolest [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/categories/): 
- [OpenServo]({{site.baseurl}}/categories/#OpenServo), a smart DC motor driver
- A [Quadrupedal Robot]({{site.baseurl}}/categories/#Quadruped)
- [Biomech Stimulator]({{site.baseurl}}/categories/#Biomech), a project for an internship I currently have

I'm also the steering lead on [MIT Motorsports](https://fsae.mit.edu), a team of super cool people of which I'm priviliged to be apart of.

Don't hesistate to reach out! Shoot me an [email](mailto:boeseany21@gmail.com) if you have questions or wanna chat. It can be about anything (robots, school, coffee, whatever).

You should also check out some of my friends' blogs too - they also have some cool posts!

If you're curious about how I made this, I used Jekyll and Github pages to build / deploy the site and used the [Affiliates Theme](https://bootstrapstarter.com/template-affiliates-bootstrap-jekyll/) with a ton of modifications (including dark mode!) to make this as cool as I could.
